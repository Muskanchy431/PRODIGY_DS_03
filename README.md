ðŸ§  Task 3 â€“ Decision Tree Classifier: Bank Marketing Prediction
As part of my Prodigy InfoTech Internship, this project focuses on building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

âœ… Key Features:
ðŸ“‚ Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Repository format)

ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing: Label Encoding for categorical variables

ðŸ§ª Split: Train-Test using train_test_split

ðŸŒ³ Model: DecisionTreeClassifier from Scikit-learn (with controlled max_depth)

ðŸ“Š Evaluation: Accuracy score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

ðŸ“ˆ Visualization: Decision tree plotted for interpretability

This task demonstrates practical application of classification algorithms in marketing and customer behavior analytics.
